# ** Amazon EMR Deployment Options **

Amazon EMR offers four deployment options to run your applications.

1. Amazon EMR on EC2
2. Amazon EMR on EKS
3. Amazon EMR on Outposts
4. Amazon EMR Serverless (Preview)

So far we leveraged EMR on EC2 deployment. In the following exercises, we will run the same workloads using EMR on EKS and EMR Serverless deployment options.

Note that all the deployment options offer the same optimized runtime Spark engine version for every EMR release label. This means you can build your application code only once and then use any of these deployment modes interchangeably to run your applications.
