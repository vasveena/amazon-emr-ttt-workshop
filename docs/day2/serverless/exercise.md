# **Exercise 2.2 - Amazon EMR Serverless**

In this exercise, you will run Hive and Spark applications using EMR Serverless.

To run the exercises in this section, you need to use your own AWS account. Since the feature is still in preview (as of writing this), you will not be charged. However, your AWS account should have been whitelisted for using EMR Serverless feature to be able to run these exercises.

If your AWS account is not whitelisted yet, you can sign up for preview of this feature using this [sign up](https://pages.awscloud.com/EMR-Serverless-Preview.html) form. Once your AWS account is whitelisted, you can come back to this exercise and run them. Since you are using your own AWS accounts, you can run this exercise even after the workshop.
