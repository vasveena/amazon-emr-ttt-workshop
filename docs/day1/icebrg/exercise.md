# ** Exercise 5 - Apache Iceberg on Amazon EMR **

In this exercise you will build incremental data lakes on EMR using Apache Iceberg. You will learn about the most important features of Iceberg like schema evolution, time traveling, streaming ingestion and also S3 traffic scaling using [Object Store File Layout](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/aws/#object-store-file-layout).

### Apache Iceberg Features

From the EMR Studio workspace Jupyterlab session, go to workshop-repo -> files -> notebook -> apache-iceberg-on-amazon-emr.ipynb. Run all the blocks of this notebook. Replace "youraccountID" in the S3 paths within the notebook with your AWS event engine account ID.

Detailed instructions are within the notebook.

Stop the session once you are done.  

### Apache Iceberg with Spark Structured Streaming

This is similar to the previous Spark streaming exercise using Apache Hudi.

From the EMR Studio workspace Jupyterlab session, go to workshop-repo -> files -> notebook -> amazon-emr-spark-streaming-apache-iceberg-demo.ipynb. Run all the blocks of this notebook. Replace "youraccountID" in the S3 paths within the notebook with your AWS event engine account ID.

Detailed instructions are within the notebook.

Stop the session once you are done.
